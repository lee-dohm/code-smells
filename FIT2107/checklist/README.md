# Equivalence (class) partitioning
  * [ ] Identify input domain of the program (both valid and invalid inputs)
  * [ ] Identify parts of that input domain that you believe that the program will treat similar (homogeneous behaviour)
  * [ ] Each equivalence partition should be disjointed (i.e. there should be no overlap)
  * [ ] For each equivalence partition, pick a small number of tests. (can pick randomly from each equiv. partition for now)
  * [ ] For each test input, make sure you know what the expected outputs are.
  * [ ] Perform test

# Category partitioning testing

  * [ ] Identify the parameters, or the input of the program. (e.g. parameters the classes or methods receive)

  * [ ] Derive characteristics for each parameter. (Can be found direct from specs of the program and some cannot like input cannot be null)

  * [ ] Add constraints (remove **invalid combinations** and **single out corner cases**) to minimise the test suite

  * [ ] Generate combinations of the input values. These form test cases
