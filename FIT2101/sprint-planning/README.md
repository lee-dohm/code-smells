The process of preparing the sprint backlog.

## Objectives

* Create sprint backlog

**Do not think about*** future sprints!

this is done at the end of the sprint in backlog maintenance.

Backlog grooming sessions don’t need to involve the whole team, so they’re less likely to end up going off-topic, and you’re losing less productivity if they do.

If you end up doing your sprint planning at epic level and therefore considering multiple iterations, that’s likely to take a lot longer than planning a single iteration.

## Sprint goals (must be short and succinct)
Optionally, team can decide on a sprint theme, or sprint goal.  

One or two sentence description of what the team will focus on for this sprint.  

Doing this can help team members set **priorities**, and makes the customer value easier for developers to understand.

It facilitates **communicating progress to stakeholders** without going into much detail.

## Pre-requisites
  * [ ] user stories (from story-writing activities during project inception)
  * [ ] user stories seeded into product backlog read for next sprint. 

**selecting a story during sprint planning should not automatically remove it from the product backlog.**

**Stories should not be removed from the product backlog until they are done according to your team’s Definition of Done.**

**Deciding that you want to implement a story doesn’t guarantee that you will be able to complete it during the sprint.**

## Start of sprint

  * [ ] [Sprint planning meeting](#sprint-planning-meeting)
  * [ ] Team decide on the aim to achieve during the sprint.
  * [ ] Select stories from the **product backlog**, break them down into tasks, and putting them into the **sprint backlog**.


## After each sprint
  * [ ] Backlog maintenance at the end of every sprint.


## Sprint planning meeting

Inside a SPM, meeting members create the [sprint backlog](#what-should-sprint-backlogs-contain).

The team also needs to plan how it will organize itself to get the sprint backlog Done.  That usually means planning at a more finely-grained level than user stories.

The meeting should be **timeboxed** (one hour per week of development is a good rule of thumb). If the time isn’t strictly limited, sprint planning can easily get out of hand. 


The team also needs to plan how it will organize itself to get the sprint backlog Done.  That usually means planning at a more finely-grained level than user stories.

**Main tasks:** <br />
1. high-priority stories need to be well understood, and choose which items from the product backlog should be selected into the sprint backlog.  

2. the team needs to figure out how to go about how to organise development so that those stories can be completed.

### Required members
The **Product Owner** needs to be there to explain the client's value priorities.

**Team members** need to be there to learn about what the client values, and to explain any relevant technical constraints.

The **Scrum Master** needs to be there to facilitate the meeting

## what should sprint backlogs contain?
Anything that your team plans to do:

* user stories
* dev stories TODO
* refactors
* spikes
* maintenance tasks

## Preparing the stories
No matter what the client’s priorities are, you shouldn’t select stories into the sprint backlog until:

* they meet the **INVEST criteria** well
* the team understands what the client wants (TODO inclusion modelling tools)
* they have been **estimated**, e.g. using planning poker, fibonacci numbering
* the Product Owner is sure of their **priority**

In the **first half of the sprint planning meeting**, the team makes sure that enough stories (or product backlog items) are ready to be selected.  This usually means:

* reviewing any **high-priority stories** that weren't reviewed during backlog management
* running estimation sessions (e.g. planning poker)
* confirming with the **Product Owner** what the stories will require and how important they are

You should try to get about **twice as many stories ready for sprint planning as you think you'll need**.  This gives your team and Product Owner more **flexibility**.

## Definition of ready
A list that defines steps have been taken before sprint planning.

Here, **Done** means that the story is completed and can be removed from the backlog, and **Ready** means that the story has been **refined, prioritized, and estimated** and is ready to be put into a sprint backlog.

You can put a note on each product backlog item (or use a kanban column) to indicate their state of Readiness. It’s handy to be able to see what needs to happen before a particular story will be Ready.


## Selecting user stories
Once enough stories are ready to be implemented, the team works with the Product Owner to select which ones should be put into the sprint backlog.

To figure out how many stories should be selected, consider the concept of velocity. That's the number of story points your team gets Done in a sprint.

* It's not what you’d planned to do
* It's not what you "need" to get through to meet a deadline
* not what you NEARLY had finished 

If it’s not Done, it’s not done, and anything else is wishful thinking.

If your team has been working together long enough, you'll usually find your velocity is pretty consistent from sprint to sprint.
