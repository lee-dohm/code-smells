# User Stories 


A **inclusive modelling** technique and tool used to form high-level requirements.


Also a reminder to perform just-in-time (JIT) analysis, because you need to have conversations with the customer in order to know features to write as user stories

## User stories things to do

### 1. Project stakeholders (product managers, project managers etc) because they are the **domain experts**.

### 2. Use the simplest tool. 

* User stories are often written on **index cards** are easy to use and inclusive modelling technique.

### 3. Remember **non-functional requirements (NFRs)**. 

* Stories can be used to describe a wide variety of requirements types. 

    * For example in Figure 1 the Students can purchase parking passes online user story is a **usage requirement** 
    * similar to a use case whereas the Transcripts will be available online via a standard browser is closer to a **technical requirement**.

### 4. Indicate the estimated size and **effort** to implement the user story

* Can use points to indicate effort. 
    * E.g. 1 point = 2.5 hours, 4 points = 10 hours to implement.

### 5. Indicate priority

* If you drop the card you can still see the priorities.

* **project stakeholders (or a rep. such as product owner)** prioritise the cards.

* **Possible naming conventions:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW, 1 to 10, unique priority order number (e.g. 344, 345, ...).

### 6. Optional: include a unique identifier

* Single source information


The only reason to do this would be to do this is if you need to maintain some sort of **traceability** between the user story and other artifacts, in particular **acceptance tests**.

e.g. The card also includes a unique identifier for the user story, in this case 173.
