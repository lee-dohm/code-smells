# Leadership and accountability

>"It has perhaps always been the case that the waging of peace is the hardest form of leadership of all.  I know of no single formula for success, but over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal, and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm, and their inspiration, to work together." <br />

## Leadership
It's the result of a person's qualities is what determines a good leader not the qualities itself.

There is no one true way to be a successful leader.  But it seems that the qualities of leadership are possessed by nearly everybody, at least to some extent.

Before we consider what a "good leader" might look like, we need to clear up one point that's often confusing: the difference between leadership and management.

## Leadership and management
A successful team needs to be both well-managed and well-led, but don’t assume that leadership and management are the same thing.

Management is about organisation: *making sure things are done*, helping *define* how work is to be done, and *ensuring that policies are followed*.  It's a manager's job to make sure that the *team has the resources* they need.

Managers also have a role in preparing for the future: they are responsible for day-to-day planning and risk management.

On the other hand, leadership has more to do with interpersonal and soft skills: it is about **motivation**, **communication**, and **empowerment**. A leader should be or make other be on the same wavelength as themselves.

Consider: is a good Scrum Master a “leader” or a “manager”, or both, or neither?  Who else adopts a leadership role in a Scrum team?  Who else adopts a management role?

Management requires one to be meticulous and *attention to detail* and good *organisational skills*, while leadership requires *communication skills*, *charisma*, and *wisdom*. Having one skill set doesn't automatically give you the other, so it’s possible to be a great manager but a poor leader, or a poor manager but a great leader. 

However good management and leadership skills are not mutually exclusive to one another.

Don’t be afraid to have your team split organisational and leadership duties between different people if you need to.  A collaborative *cross-functional* team won’t always have a single leader.  It is possible for different individuals to lead at different times, depending on circumstances.
