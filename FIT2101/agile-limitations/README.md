## When shouldn't you use Agile?

### When it’s a bad fit for your organisation
* organizational culture is opposed to uncertainty or change
* you have a lot of reporting requirements
* company structure requires a traditional Project Manager to be in charge
### When it’s a bad fit for your customers
* they don’t have time to spend with developers
* they require a very predictable process
### When it’s a bad fit for the product
* needs a very large team, or has stringent quality requirements
* requirements are known in advance, well-understood,and won’t change
### When it’s a bad fit for the team
* team can’t meet frequently (e.g. time zone differences)
* team is very large
* team does’t know each other well,or there is distrust.
* team lacks the maturity to self-manage

## Higher management

### Senior management might impose unagile conditions

#### Frequent writing reports
One of the teamicide issues: bureaucracy.

#### Frequent personnel changes
Need to consistently form new cohesive teams focused on a common goal or purpose..

#### Insisting on micromanaging the process
Teams can no longer always actively participate in decision making. 

No member can make decisions within their area of expertise. 

Destroys collaborative teams and self-organisation.

## Team doesn't collaborate well (no long self-organising)

* Competitiveness: team mates are less likely to communicate especially their flaws. Team mates will want to carry out tasks alone. "Lone wolf"

* Don't know their teammates: do not know each other's responsibilities, maturity level and area of expertise.

* Don't know each other's workload capacity: who's got a lot to do, and who's got spare capacity?


## Customer (representative) isn't interested:

Scrum requires inspect and adapt and agile needs frequent input from a customer representative.

**Bad:** customer hands over a list of requirements and not hear from you again.

**Bad:** requirement specification is bound by contract. Changes are hard or impossible to apply

## Teams hangs on to their old ways

Moving from a traditional or ad-hock process means changing a lot of things
* responsibilities are decentralised (no micromanagement, flat team structure, )
* reporting requirements change
* team is responsible for its own process improvement
* testing is done more frequently
* team does its own estimation (self-organising and agile)

## Overplanning (losing agility)

Agile is more of an **adaptive** approach not really a predictive approach. Rigorous planning is not required (e.g. planning or the details for each iteration during process inception is not required). 

It is or for planning and estimation to be not perfect because it can be addressed in retro if estimation is actually causing problems. Late it can be readjusted (adaptive approach). 

## Unreasonable expectations (plan to fail)

**Expecting much faster development:** <br />
* Projects and teams will benefit from Agile to different extents (from none to heaps).

**Expecting to be able to cope with no documentations or planning at all:** <br />
* Need to strike a balance between plan and ad-hoc.
    * Avoid duplication in the planning and documentations.
* Naive to expect non-trivial project will succeed if attempted completely ad-hoc.

## Scope Creep (Do not over-estimate what you can do)

**Weakness:** agile processes put less effort into nailing down requirements at the start of the project
* If the customer is unreasonable or overenthusiastic, this can lead to scope creep
    * The requirements keep expanding or shifting – so the project stops approaching completion

* Product features (user stories) are the **only** negotiable part of the product (e.g. not quality).
* Team needs to say no to some new or changed user stories... but this can be difficult
