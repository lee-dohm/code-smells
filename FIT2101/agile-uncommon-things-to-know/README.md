# Some hard to remember things


## Putting people first



### Plug-Compatible Programming Units (people are not tools, each person can take many roles)

> it's just saying in traditional or old methodologies people are treated as replaceable parts and that this works for predictable processes but humans hence programmers are not 'plug-ins' and are treated as replaceable parts. The effect of this is it dehumanizes the workforce and Martin Fowler states the result is the good people end up moving out to where they aren't treated as so and such management is left with people who end up actually being replaceable parts which (imo) is bad for innovation and other such things a business should try maintain.

#### Are the people involved in software development replaceable parts? 

One of the key features of agile methods is that they reject this assumption.

> In the title, [of his article] I refer to people as "components". That is how people are treated in the process / methodology design literature. The mistake in this approach is that "people" are highly variable and non-linear, with unique success and failure modes. Those factors are first-order, not negligible factors. Failure of process and methodology designers to account for them contributes to the sorts of unplanned project trajectories we so often see. <br />

**BAD:** One of the aims of traditional methodologies is to develop a process where the people involved are replaceable parts. 

With such a process you can treat people as resources who are available in various types. You have an analyst, some coders, some testers, a manager. The individuals aren't so important, only the roles are important. That way if you plan a project it doesn't matter which analyst and which testers you get, just that you know how many you have so you know how the number of resources affects your plan.

In his paper Characterizing People as Non-Linear, First-Order Components in Software Development, he makes the point that predictable processes require components that behave in a predictable way. However people are not predictable components.

If you expect all your developers to be plug-compatible programming units, you don't try to treat them as individuals. This lowers morale (and productivity). The good people look for a better place to be on their own.

## Programmer as Responsible Professionals (Factory workers vs agilists)

**Talorist notion:** <br />
Part of this is that many factory workers are not the most intelligent or creative people, in part this is because there is a tension between management and workers in that management makes more money when the workers make less.


The Taylorist notion of a separate planning department that decides how to do things only works if the planners understand how to do the job better than those doing it. 

If you have **bright, motivated people doing the job then this does not hold**.

## Managing a People Oriented Process (resisting change)

Accepting **technical leadership** is a big shift for many people in management positions. Such an approach requires a sharing of responsibility where **developers and management have an equal place in the leadership of the project**. Notice that I say equal. Management still plays a role, but recognizes the expertise of developers.

This half life of technical skills is without parallel in any other industry. Even technical people have to recognize that entering management means their technical skills will wither rapidly.

Ex-developers need to recognize that their technical skills will rapidly disappear and they need to trust and rely on current developers.

## The Difficulty of Measurement
Impossible to measure productivity. For example sprint velocity and daily effort completed can be hacked by adjust the effort estimates of each item.

> Anything that's missing has the inevitable result that the **doers will alter what they do to produce the best measures**, even if that clearly reduces the true effectiveness of what they do. <br />
> -- Robert Austin

You have to choose between measurement-based management and delegatory management (where the doers decide how to do the work). 

| measurement-based management                              | delegatory style management |
| :-:                                                       | :-:                         |
| Suited for repetitive trivial work                        |                             |
| A lot of knowledge on requirements easily measured output |                             |
