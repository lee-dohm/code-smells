# DevOps

## What is DevOps?

Put simply, DevOps refers to the unification of developers and operations staff.

In large companies, developers and IT operations staff are traditionally located in different teams.  

They have different roles and responsibilities. 

* Development teams are responsible for creating new software, 

* Operations teams are responsible for managing the company's **IT infrastructure** and **maintaining existing software**.

## Problems with siloed development and operations team:

Unfortunately, friction between Development and Operations is all too common.

If Development and Operations are siloed, they tend to be adversaries. For Development and QA when software fails when trying to integrate it with existing infrastructure, **developers tend to blame operators for incorrect deployment while operators blame developers for producing a fragile system**.

## Conflicting objectives
It is the developers' responsibility to create new functionality and to get it to end users as quickly as possible, but it is operators' responsibility to keep the company's systems stable.

Whenever a new version of the software is produced and deployed, there's always a risk that it won't work.  That means that it's in Ops's interest to say no to Devs' requests for deployment -- and when they do agree to deploy, they often introduce a delay while the new system undergoes further testing, or while fallback systems are set up in case of failure.

This makes developers feel frustrated: they may feel that Ops staff are acting as gatekeepers, preventing them from achieving their goal of timely software delivery.  On the other hand, Ops staff are equally annoyed at Dev staff for producing code that is not bug-free, taking down the servers they maintain and providing customers and end-users with an unreliable and unsatisfying experience.

This situation became especially troublesome in the early '00s as the internet became increasingly important.  The business environment was changing rapidly, and so were customers' expectations -- requirements changed along with them.  Agile development methodologies were a very good fit for these times, and did enable teams to release code more frequently.  But this didn't help the situation for Ops staff: even though the software may be created quickly, actually deploying it still took time.  Frequent deployments are hard when you're trying to mitigate risk.

By the mid-to-late '00s, relations between Dev and Ops had become a frequent source of complaint. Ops staff wondered whether Dev had any idea how risky these rapid deployments were, while Dev wondered whether Ops cared at all about responsiveness to change

DevOps arises from a single insight: it is everybody's responsibility to support the businessâ€™s goals and activities by enabling change.  That means that everybody should share in the management of risk -- Dev and Ops needed to become unified.

## Breaking down silos
DevOps means breaking down silos so that developers, operators, and QA staff all collaborate.
