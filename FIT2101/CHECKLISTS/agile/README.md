# Agile checklist


  * [ ] Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

  * [ ] Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

  * [ ] Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

  * [ ] Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

  * [ ] Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

  * [ ] The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

  * [ ] Working software is the primary measure of progress.

  * [ ] Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

  * [ ] Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

  * [ ] Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

  * [ ] The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

  * [ ] At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
