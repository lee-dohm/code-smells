# Practice exam


## Question 1 (4 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 12 Marks)
Here is an idea for a product:
Rovr is a service that helps dog owners find people to provide services for their pets. You can think
of it as “Uber for pets”.
Service providers register themselves via a special app, verify their identity and contact details, and
select which services they provide bathing, clipping, dog walking, pet-sitting, etc. Pet owners can
use the Rovr website or app to request a service. Rovr will offer the job to appropriate service
providers in the local area. After the service has been provided, the owner gets to rate the
provider’s service on a scale of 1-5, and the provider can rate both the owner and the dog – the
system charges an extra fee for handling dogs that are known to bite.
All transactions are logged and audited once a month to verify that service providers are being paid
on a timely basis. A small team of technical staff at head office will manage these logs as well as
maintaining the servers and responding to tech support request


### Who should be invited to a story-writing workshop for this project, and why? Write about half a page. (4 marks)

* Product owner because the product owners should be the person responsible for coming up with ideas for the app. The product owner is the individual responsible for maximising profits and the value out of the team.

* The team (programmers and scrum master). These people knows the domain of the programming language, they are able to suggest functional as well as non-function requirements for user stories. Some user-stories may be not related to the functionality such as robustness, security, usability so the team can point these out.


* Stakeholders or executives, managers. Through stakeholder mapping, you can locate stakeholders who are responsible

* Potential users like a pet owner or service providers. Services and pets are of their domain of knowledge so they can point interesting feature related user stories.



### Suggest three personas that could be used in this workshop

* As a user. This is for regular users of the app. This is often for cases of using or accessing parts of the app so all users should be accomplish these

* As a pet owner. In the pet owner portal, the user should be able to do things only pet owners can do such as selecting a specific service for their pets
.
* As a service provider, user stories that are limited to only service providers

* As a programmer for coding stories (?)


###  Consider the information that Rovr’s system will need to store. 

#### i. List two security-related risks related to the storage of this information. (2 marks)

Identity details may include the user's id info like driver's licence. Accidentally leaking it by means of hackers or security leaks is detrimental. Risk transfer can be put into place by let's another organisation or service handle this part. Instead of relying on the head off of a small team of potentially inexperienced technical stuff (operations team), move the sensitive information to a more establish organisation to manage the data.

To avoid accidentally leaking contact details of users risk mitigation can be used by training operation team (a small team of technical staff at head office) how to handle the server properly. Also hiring penetration testers is a good choice because they have better domain of knowledge in this regard.


#### ii. Suggest a mitigation strategy for at least one of these risks. (3 mark)

Risk Monitoring
- For identified risks, consistently monitor the risks and take steps to ensure to follow certain policies.

Risk avoid
- Instead of storing the contact details or id of the user. Try to it through another means such as only verifying user through phone number sms or log in through email provider e.g. Gmail
