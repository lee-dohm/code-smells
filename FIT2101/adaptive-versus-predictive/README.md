## benefits of adaptive process

### Customers (competitive edge in the market)

Customers get much **more responsive software development**. 

A usable, although minimal, system can go into production early on. The customer can then **change its capabilities according to changes in the business**, and also from learning from how the system is used in reality.

> A late change in requirements is a competitive advantage.

### Working software and final system (a mirage)

The point of this is that there is nothing like a tested, integrated system for bringing a forceful dose of reality into any project.

> Documents can hide all sorts of flaws. Untested code can hide plenty of flaws.
