## Statically terminate

There are **three unknown reactions** (including forces and moments)

### Members 

### Is it determinate?
`m + 3 = 2j`

#### if m+3 < 2j
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The structure is unstable and will collapse under load.

#### if m+3 > 2j
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the structure has redundant members and the 
forces cannot be determined using equilibrium equation 
alone. The structure is statically indeterminate.
